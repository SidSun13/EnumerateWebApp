## Inspiration
Our mission is to have a place where students from around the world can come together to share resources, ideas, and smarter learning strategies. In a world where knowledge leads to success, we believe everyone can be successful with access to proper materials. Similar to popular media applications like Instagram and Discord, we feel that a place like Enumerate can foster this plan.

## What it does
Our web application allows students from around the world communicate in group chats, find study partners, and gain access to thousands of resources ranging from cheat-sheets to allowed textbooks.

## How we built it
Using Firebase, Firestore, and react, our team was able to create a web application where we were able to connect, read, and write information to the server, as well as allow uploading of files and various file formats, too.

## Challenges we ran into
As it was our first time working with Firebase and Firestore, and with a limited background in Javascript and React, it was quite difficult getting everything setup and good to go. With setbacks like npm and npx commands not being recognized, to our database server failing to see reads and writes despite handling rules correctly, this project was a great challenge for us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Although we may not have finished everything we envisioned, our team is very proud of what we had made so far. Actually connecting a database to a project like this for the first time was the biggest thrill, as it greatly motivated us to continue working and implementing the features we wanted. Having dealt with node and react for pretty much the first time, it was rewarding to feel that we were able to learn so much in such a small timeframe.

## What we learned
Besides learning how to implement backend and fullstack features in a web application, it was also very important for us learning how to work as a team. Our setbacks and failures at the beginning lead us to question our own ability to complete this Hackathon, and our teamwork in making this application possible was a big part of what we learned to do. Implementing simple code-checks and comments on our group's work allowed us to heighten our knowledge and teamwork.

## What's next for Enumerate
We hope to continue our plan for Enumerate as well as our ideathon submission, as we feel the issues we attempted to solve are engrained in our society greatly. Starting off by implementing the features we left off in this 5-day window, we can slowly improve and have plans to launch our application and tackle these issues for good.
